<p><strong>Hellooooo 👋</strong></p>

<p>🚀 My name is Constance and I have recently reached the next step with the <strong>web developer</strong> training at Le Wagon.
After enriching my experience through a gap year in Australia, where I was able to broaden my personal and professional horizons, I am now ready to take on new challenges in web development.</p>

<p>🔍 A project I've just completed: <strong>CultureJam</strong> (Web app)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborative Ruby On Rails project completed in a team of 4 people over 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Dynamic social network dedicated to cultural diffusion and discovery, allowing the sharing of various recommendations and inspirations</li>
</ul>

<p>💬 Currently looking for professional opportunities in Web Development, I’m open to collaborations and innovative projects that will allow me to blossom! So feel free to contact me via <strong><a href="mailto:constance.lesaffre@hotmail.fr">email</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/constance-lesaffre/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a></strong>.</p>
